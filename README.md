Foundry VTT implementation for Two Little Mice's Outgunned RPG.

This is a fan made implementation of the Outgunned RPG, it is neither supported or endorsed by Two Little mice.  It provides the sheets and system to run Outgunned on Foundry Virtual Table Top.

To the best of my knowledge this project does not include any materials from the official books and you will have to enter manually the weapons, skills, items, etc… to be able to play. The implementation provides the functionality to create and use your own skills, tropes etc.

Foundry VTT support is covered by Limited License Agreement for Module Development.

I started this implementation with the Boilerplate system by Asacolips.
